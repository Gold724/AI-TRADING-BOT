# Environment Variables Security

## Git Safeguards for .env Files

This project has been configured with the following safeguards to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive environment variables:

1. **Added `.env` to `.gitignore`**
   - The `.env` file is now excluded from Git tracking
   - This prevents accidental commits of sensitive credentials

2. **Removed `.env` from Git cache**
   - The command `git rm --cached .env` was used to stop tracking the file
   - The local file remains intact, but Git no longer tracks changes to it

3. **Added Git pre-commit hook**
   - Located at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`
   - Automatically blocks any commit containing `.env` files
   - Provides a clear error message when attempted

## Best Practices for Environment Variables

1. **Never commit `.env` files to version control**
   - Use `.env.example` as a template with dummy values
   - Document required variables without exposing actual values

2. **Rotate credentials if accidentally exposed**
   - If credentials are ever committed, consider them compromised
   - Immediately rotate any exposed API keys, tokens, or passwords

3. **Use environment-specific configurations**
   - Consider separate `.env.development`, `.env.production` files
   - Ensure all environment files are in `.gitignore`

## Verifying Protection

To verify that your `.env` file is protected:

1. Run `git status` - the `.env` file should not appear in tracked files
2. Try to force-add with `git add -f .env` and then commit - the pre-commit hook should block it
3. Check `.gitignore` to confirm `.env` is listed
