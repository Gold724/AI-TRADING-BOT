## Architecture

The Fibonacci Strategy Dashboard is built on a Flask-based web server that interfaces with the existing Fibonacci strategy implementation. Key components include:

1. **Web Interface**: A responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for user interaction.
2. **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for retrieving data and executing actions.
3. **Data Management**: Functions for loading and saving trade history and signal data.
4. **Trade Execution**: Integration with the `FibonacciExecutor` for executing trades.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- All dependencies required by the AI Trading Sentinel project

### Installation

1. Ensure the AI Trading Sentinel project is properly set up.
2. The dashboard is included in the `backend` directory as `fibonacci_strategy_dashboard.py`.

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
python backend/fibonacci_strategy_dashboard.py
```

Additional command-line options:
- `--host`: Server host (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port`: Server port (default: 5001)
- `--history`: Trade history file path (default: logs/fibonacci_trades.json)
- `--signals`: Signals file path (default: sample_fibonacci_signals.json)

Example:
```bash
python backend/fibonacci_strategy_dashboard.py --port 5002 --history custom_history.json
```

## Usage Guide

### Executing a Quick Trade

1. Navigate to the Dashboard tab.
2. Fill in the Quick Trade form with the required parameters:
   - Symbol (e.g., EURUSD, BTCUSD)
   - Side (Buy/Sell)
   - Quantity
   - Entry Price
   - Fibonacci Low
   - Fibonacci High
   - Optional: Stop Loss, Take Profit
   - Stealth Level (1-3)
3. Click "Execute Trade" to start the trade execution.

### Managing Signals

1. Navigate to the Signals tab.
2. To add a new signal, click "Add New Signal" and fill in the required information.
3. To execute an existing signal, click the "Execute" button next to the signal.
4. To edit or delete a signal, use the respective buttons next to the signal.

### Monitoring Active Trades

1. Navigate to the Dashboard tab.
2. The Active Fibonacci Trades table displays all currently active trades.
3. Use the "View" button to see detailed information about a specific trade.
4. Use the "Close" button to manually close a trade if needed.

### Analyzing Trade History

1. Navigate to the Trade History tab.
2. Review the complete history of executed trades with their details.

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Fibonacci Strategy Dashboard integrates seamlessly with the existing AI Trading Sentinel ecosystem, particularly with the Fibonacci strategy implementation. It utilizes the same `FibonacciExecutor` class for trade execution and accesses the same trade history and signal files.

## Security Considerations

- The dashboard is designed for local use and does not implement authentication by default.
- For production deployment, additional security measures should be implemented, including proper authentication, HTTPS, and input validation.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Data Updates**: Implement WebSocket for real-time updates without page refresh.
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Add more sophisticated performance analysis and visualization tools.
3. **Multi-Strategy Support**: Extend the dashboard to support other trading strategies beyond Fibonacci.
4. **User Authentication**: Add user accounts and authentication for multi-user environments.
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance mobile responsiveness for on-the-go trading management.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard Not Loading**: Ensure the Flask server is running and accessible at the specified host and port.
2. **Trade Execution Failures**: Check the console output for error messages and ensure the trading interface is properly configured.
3. **Missing Data**: Verify that the history and signals files exist at the specified paths.
