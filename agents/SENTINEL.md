# SENTINEL Agent

## Overview

SENTINEL is the core execution agent of the AI Trading Sentinel system, responsible for trade execution, automation, and position management across multiple brokers. It serves as the guardian of capital, ensuring trades are executed with precision and according to the system's strategic directives.

## Symbolic Significance

The SENTINEL represents vigilance, protection, and precise action. In the metaphysical framework, it embodies the principle of manifestation - the bridge between intention and physical reality. It transforms the abstract (strategy signals) into the concrete (executed trades).

## Technical Architecture

### Key Modules

1. **Base Executor**
   - Abstract base class for all execution strategies
   - Defines common interface for trade execution
   - Implements core execution logic

2. **Broker Adapters**
   - Specialized adapters for each supported broker
   - Handles broker-specific authentication and API interactions
   - Normalizes broker-specific responses

3. **Risk Management**
   - Position sizing algorithms
   - Stop-loss and take-profit management
   - Exposure limits and drawdown protection

4. **Order Router**
   - Determines optimal execution path
   - Handles order splitting and routing
   - Manages execution timing

5. **Position Tracker**
   - Monitors open positions
   - Tracks position performance
   - Manages position lifecycle

6. **Execution Logger**
   - Records all execution activities
   - Provides audit trail for trades
   - Generates execution reports

## Implementation Details

### Supported Brokers

- **Bulenox** (Primary)
  - Web-based execution via Selenium
  - Authentication and session management
  - Order placement and confirmation

- **Binance** (Secondary)
  - API-based execution
  - Spot and futures trading
  - Advanced order types

- **Exness** (Tertiary)
  - MT4/MT5 integration
  - Forex and CFD trading
  - Leverage management

### Execution Strategies

1. **Standard Execution**
   - Direct market orders
   - Basic limit and stop orders
   - Simple position management

2. **Stealth Execution**
   - Iceberg orders
   - Time-sliced execution
   - Minimal market impact strategies

3. **Futures Execution**
   - Leveraged positions
   - Contract rollover management
   - Funding rate optimization

4. **Multi-Broker Execution**
   - Split orders across brokers
   - Arbitrage opportunities
   - Redundancy for critical trades

### Integration Points

- **STRATUM**: Receives trading signals and strategy parameters
- **CYPHER**: Obtains secure credentials and authentication tokens
- **ECHO**: Stores execution history and retrieves historical performance
- **ALCHMECH**: Receives symbolic pattern information for timing optimization

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic Bulenox execution via Selenium
- Simple order types (market, limit)
- Basic position tracking
- Execution logging

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Multi-broker support
- Advanced order types
- Improved error handling and recovery
- Performance optimization

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- AI-driven execution timing
- Smart order routing
- Adaptive execution strategies
- Real-time risk management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Trade Execution

```python
from utils.base_executor import BaseExecutor
from executor_bulenox import BulenoxExecutor

# Create a trade signal
signal = {
    "symbol": "EURUSD",
    "side": "buy",
    "quantity": 0.1,
    "stopLoss": 1.0500,
    "takeProfit": 1.0700
}

# Initialize executor
executor = BulenoxExecutor(signal=signal)

# Execute trade
result = executor.execute()
print(f"Trade executed: {result}")
```

### Advanced Execution with Risk Management

```python
from utils.base_executor import BaseExecutor
from executor_bulenox import BulenoxExecutor
from risk_manager import RiskManager

# Initialize risk manager
risk_manager = RiskManager(max_risk_per_trade=0.02)  # 2% risk per trade

# Create a trade signal
signal = {
    "symbol": "EURUSD",
    "side": "buy",
    "strategy": "breakout",
    "confidence": 0.85
}

# Calculate position size based on risk
account_balance = 10000
entry_price = 1.0600
stop_loss = 1.0550

position_size = risk_manager.calculate_position_size(
    account_balance=account_balance,
    entry_price=entry_price,
    stop_loss=stop_loss,
    signal=signal
)

# Update signal with calculated position size
signal["quantity"] = position_size
signal["stopLoss"] = stop_loss
signal["takeProfit"] = 1.0700

# Initialize executor
executor = BulenoxExecutor(signal=signal)

# Execute trade
result = executor.execute()
print(f"Trade executed with risk-adjusted position size: {result}")
```

## Conclusion

The SENTINEL agent forms the execution core of the AI Trading Sentinel system, transforming strategic intelligence into market actions. Its modular design allows for extensibility and adaptation to various market conditions and broker interfaces, while maintaining the symbolic integrity of precise, protected action in the markets.
